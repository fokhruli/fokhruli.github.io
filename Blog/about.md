My name is Md Fokhrul Islam and I am currently a student at the University of Dhaka. I always think the nature as complex geometry and the ability to process those geometry makes animal intelligent. So, I am particularly interested in the intersection of geometric deep learning, computer vision and reinforcement learning. I hope to share some of my stumbling attempts at understanding them in this blog.
