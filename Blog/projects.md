### Graph Convolution Networks for Assessment of Physical Rehabilitation Exercises {Keyword: Attention, ST-GCN}:
- We designed an automatic agent which can evaluate(continuous value) patients individual exercise and also give feedback based on their performance. 
- We also leveraged the properties of skeleton graph from video to get better result.


### Development of sentiment analysis system for English-Bengali(BN-EN) Code-Mixed data {Keyword: NLP, Code-Mixing}:
- In this work, we are trying to developed an system which can classify sentiment of code mixed(BN-EN) review. 
- Code mixed data did not follow any certain prepossessing(like pos-tagging, stemming, lemmatization etc) in Natural Language processing system. 
- So, we are trying to build a system which can solve this problem.


### Classifying ASD/TD on Eye-Tracking Data Using Saliency Maps and Deep learning {Keyword: Saliency map, Fixation map, Autism Spectrum Disorder}:
- Our project proposes a visual saliency based deep learning model for automatic and quantitative classification of eye-tracking. 
- Instead of directly extracting features from the fixation data, our method employs several well-known computational models of visual attention to predict eye fixation locations as saliency maps to get better result.

### Learning to Trade Using Deep Reinforcement Learning <span style="color:red"> [[report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VS5kPmfvLVHlCoOZA38eC5wtba3Z7xll/view?usp=sharing)</span> :
- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm which can make optimal policy and maximizing the profit it receives from its own actions and resulting positions. 
- Our model was tested on both S&P 500 and Dhaka Stock Exchange(DSE) data
